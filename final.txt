The perfect summer's day of five minutes ago had gone. Instead, the sky was darker than the blackest night. But that wasn't the worst thing. The sun wasn't there, and the moon and stars were also gone.

People were shouting and screaming. They started calling their families on the telephone because they were afraid they had all gone too. Tomas felt as if it was hard to breathe, but he counted to ten and tried to breathe slowly.
He sat at the main computer and started reading the information and numbers from his experiment.
But he couldnâ€™t find anything to explain what was happening. He ran out of the exit with the rest of his
team until they were all outside the building. Everyone else in the building was outside, frightened and confused. They were using the screens and lights on their mobile phones to see better.
Several people got in their cars and turned on the lights. They drove to the entrance to make a small area of light for everybody to stand together.
The street lights turned on, but most people were still afraid.
